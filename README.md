This is a public script repository of scripts for the Steam client, written specifically for the Outlands server ruleset. Most of the scripts I have written, but I always appreciate hosting contributions from others. The directory layout should be self explanatory if you are looking for anything in particular.

## Reminders

:bulb: To make copying/pasting easier, use the [RAW] view of the file. 

:bug: If you discover a bug, or a script stops working. Please contact me directly in discord (Jewele). The server does change from time to time, requiring updates - and I won't know these scripts are broken until someone tells me.

:mailbox: I love script submissions or ideas. Even if you are a new scripter - send me your ideas. I can't do all of this alone.

:unamused: Please do not fork or duplicate this repository. If you aren't going to maintain it - then it gets out of date, then I get messages from people who have broken stuff. I can't stop you - I can only ask that you please do not do this.

## Pardon the mess :construction: 

I am rebuilding this site for 2020.
